Hello, my name is Jonathon Makepeace and I'm a recent graduate to Western Govenors University. I completed my bachelor's in Computer Science and my associate's
  in Science. 
  
I'm currently looking for developer positions that use Java or C# mainly, because they are my most proficient programming languages. I know a great deal of SQL
  and have used Microsoft Azure database for personal projects. I'm willing to learn new technologies and methodologies to progress my career in software development.
