Hello, my name is Jonathon Makepeace and I'm a recent graduate to Western Govenors University. I completed my bachelor's in Computer Science and my associate's
  in Science. 
  
I'm currently looking for developer positions related to either Java or C#, as they are my most proficient languages. I know a great deal of SQL
  and have used Microsoft Azure database for personal projects. 
  
Most of my experience is related to desktop applications using Java and JavaFX, while occasionally connecting to a database for storage. I plan to 
  create a web application using .Net framework and C# soon.
